# KanaPal

KanaPal is a web application specifically made for people to learn hiragana and katakana easily. It helps you to learn hiragana, katakana, or both at the same time!

# What is it built on?

It is built on Next.JS with the help of Tailwind CSS and Mantine UI Kit. The mappings between hiragana and katakana characters to roman characters are done by ChatGPT.

*Fun fact: The color palette and fonts were also selected by ChatGPT!*

# How to run locally?

Clone the app, and then run `npm i` followed with `npm run dev`.
